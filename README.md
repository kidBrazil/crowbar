## CROWBAR SASS Boilerplate

This SASS boilerplate is to be used as a starting point for Moreira Development projects. The intention is for the library to grow as we start seeing repeated patterns and to save time on initial project setups

### Usage

1. First install the package using NPM after requesting access to the company NPM registry
```
npm install @moreira-development/crowbar-sass
```

2. Import the library into your .js pipeline
```
import '@moreira-development/crowbar-sass`
```

or

2. Import it to the main Stylesheet with
```
@import "~@moreira-development/crowbar-sass";
```
